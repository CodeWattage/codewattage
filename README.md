# Hey, I'm John üëã

Engineer by day, tinkerer by night. I‚Äôm fascinated by how data, automation, and a bit of clever hardware can make renewable energy systems smarter - and, apparently, how much gear you can fit into a two-bedroom tenement flat.

My homelab is‚Ä¶ ambitious: a Dell PowerEdge rack running proxmox Proxmox, a stack of VMs, Home Assistant, a tangle of switches, OPNsense integrated with Traefik & CrowdSec, open-source microservices (some useful some completely ridiculous and uneccesary), and even an ESP32Dev keeping an eye on the temperature in my log burner. Oh, and a weather station on the roof - my wife is very patient.

It‚Äôs probably excessive, but it‚Äôs fueled by curiosity, continuous learning, and the simple joy of making things talk to each other.

## What I'm up to

My professional background spans 20+ years in operations/maintenance engineering and risk management across renewables, defence, and critical infrastructure. Over time, I became fascinated by the data and automation side of things, starting with Python scripts to analyse SCADA data and automate reporting, and somehow ending up with Kubernetes clusters, IoT sensors, and dashboards everywhere.

These days I spend my free time building and learning by turning operational data into insights. I create tools to analyse SCADA and performance data from renewable sites, experiment with time-series databases and predictive maintenance algorithms, and connect SCADA, BMS, Electrical HV and metering system data to modern analytics stacks. I also enjoy exploring open-source projects that sit at the intersection of hardware and software; always looking for ways to learn something new or make systems work a little smarter.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
My playground for turning industrial data into insights - some skills are solid, others experimental‚Ä¶ curiosity always in beta:

## Why I code

Started automating tedious operational reporting, and somewhere along the way I fell down the rabbit hole and never looked back. I get a kick out of solving problems by building purpose-made solutions, mostly using open-source tools, so that even the small guys can benefit from tech without spending hundreds of thousands on magic black box proprietary software that solves half a problem. There‚Äôs something deeply satisfying about turning messy industrial data into predictive insights, or creating tools that catch problems before they snowball.

I love bridging industrial hardware and modern software, making systems smarter, more reliable, and genuinely fun to tinker with. My homelab is a testament to curiosity: elaborate, occasionally excessive, but always educational.

## Personal projects & interests

üè† **Home Lab Adventures**
- Multi-node k3s clusters (probably overkill, but excellent for real-world Kubernetes practice)
- InfluxDB + Grafana monitoring for pretty much everything - because if it can be measured, it can be optimised
-	Home Assistant integrations that occasionally behave‚Ä¶ teaching patience, troubleshooting, and practical IoT skills
-	Smart home experiments: heating control, weather-driven automation, electric blinds - hands-on fun connecting hardware, APIs, and logic, with the occasional ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt this working?‚Äù moment

üìä **Data & Analytics**
- Python scripts for renewable energy performance analysis and O&M optimisation
- Root cause analysis tools inspired by industrial investigations
- Time-series data pipelines for turbines, BMS, and HV systems
- Geospatial analysis with QGIS (licensed drone pilot for site surveys)

üåç **Sustainability Tech**
- Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society with interest in environmental tech
- Making energy data more accessible
- Open source advocate for accelerating the energy transition
